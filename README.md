Final Computer Science Project, 2020 : Omer Hen, Shimon Ben Zvi High School 

Description

This project covers the research and implementation of an artificial neural network that recognizes hand written digits.
The implementation of common concepts in this field of interest such as: Backpropagation, Feedfoward and Gradient Descent 
is done without using third-party libraries, using only Numpy for fast and efficient linear algebra calculations.
The training and testing data is imported from the MNIST database.

Prerequisites

Python 3 and the following libraries installted:

 - Numpy 
 - Matplotlib
 - Picke
 - gzip
 - urllib
 - json 
 

Installation

Download 'Final Network.py' and run it using a Python IDE
