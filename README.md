## MNIST Hand Written Digits Artificial Neural Network

# Description

This project covers the research and implementation of an artificial neural network that recognizes hand written digits.
The implementation of common concepts in this field of interest such as: Backpropagation, Feedfoward and Gradient Descent 
is done without using third-party libraries and from scratch, using only Numpy for fast and efficient linear algebra calculations.
The training and testing data is imported from the MNIST database.

# Prerequisites

Python 3 and the following libraries installed:
 - Numpy 
 - Matplotlib
 - Picke
 - gzip
 - urllib
 
If you would like to use the profiling option to measure system efficiency, please make sure you have the following libraries installed as well:

 - cProfile
 - pstats

# Installation

Download 'Final Network.py' and run it using a Python IDE.
